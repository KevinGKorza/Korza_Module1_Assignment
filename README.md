# Korza_Module1_Assignment
This is the GitHub for the homework assignment for Module 1
Credit goes to the Style.css and Index.html codes found in the assignment
The HTML code has been refracted, but doesn't open correctly when in it's own gitbub, it oppens correctly in the class github (CONN-VIRT-FSF-PT-06-2022-U-LOLC)
